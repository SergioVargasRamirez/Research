I am not a matematician. I have, however, to teach my students about some important teorems in our statistics course. One of these theorems is the [Central Limit Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem).

I ussually do this using an animation I created using the R package 'animation'. The code goes:

You will hopefully get an animated gif (i.e. Central_Teorem.gif) looking like this:
