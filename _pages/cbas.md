CBAS is the abbreviation I use to designate a **c**ommon **b**lue **a**quarium **s**ponge we keep in our salt-water tanks.

I dubbed it so because this species...

 1. is **C**ommon in salt-water aquaria as judge by the multiple hobbists complaining about it.
 2. is **B**lue, but we also have a purple one and a green one.
 3. it leaves in **A**quaria, and we have no information about its biogeographic origin. And,
 4. is a **S**ponge.
